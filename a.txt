The aforementioned agents each perform specific actions based on the current condition of the environment. Often these actions alter a certain aspect of the surrounding, thereby affecting the subsequent actions of other agents. In this way, the model captures the interactions among the agents and the environment.

Agents are primarily assigned to a particular occupation. Under unfavorable circumstances, however, they are allowed to switch to other occupations as well for a certain period of time.

Golpata (Nypa fruticans) forms a major part of the flora of the Sundarbans. A certain group of people named Bawalis primarily depends on extracting Golpata throughout the year. To prevent the Golpata stock from dwindling abruptly, each Bawali is granted permission to extract a certain maximum amount of Golpata. Moreover, the own financial condition of the Bawali gives rise to an extraction capacity which puts another limit to the actual extraction amount. In case the extraction capacity of a Bawali falls below the minimum allowed capacity of a Bawali, he switches to farming for a certain  If the agentâ€™s permitted amount happens to be zero, he is expected not to perform any extraction that year, which in turn leads to a decline in his extraction capacity for the next year. However, a certain portion of the population turns out to be pilferers. They violate these restrictions and extract Golpata even if they are not granted to do so. Each year, natural hazards result in a loss of Golpata stock, which the authority tries to replenish by enhancing the conservation rate.
